# Smart_Performance_Database_System
This project focuses on creating a new database management system for an IT firm to review employees’ work performance by looking into employees’ basic information, HRMS data and a set of data extracted from individual videos recordings on a daily basis using their own video image recognition system. Given the current COVID-19 situation, most employees are forced to work from home, which presents a new challenge for business managers and HR team to track their employees' work performance. Despite having HR tracking systems, managers spend a long time generating employees’ performance metrics as they are not available in real time. This exhausts their spirit resulting in less time and effort invested on other important tasks like building strategies, business expansion and sales volume improvement.
